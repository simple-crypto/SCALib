Not released
------------

v0.5.1 (2023/02/16)
-------------------

* Fix bug in ``rank_estimation``.
* Improve documentation and README.
* Run rust tests.
* Better selection of default threadpool size.

v0.5.0 (2023/02/08)
-------------------

* Deprecate ``SASCAGraph`` in favor of the new ``FactorGraph`` which provides:

    - Overall much less restrictions on operations, including suport for:

        + non-bijective tables
        + multiple public operands
        + NOT gate

    - A ``sanity_check`` feature: verify that the graph is compatible with known value assignment (useful for debugging a graph).
    - Optimized bitwise AND: ``O(nc*log(nc))`` instead of ``O(nc^2)``.

* Re-design ``scalib.config`` to handle more configuration in a single ``Config`` class. **Breaking change** to ``scalib.config`` and ``scalib.config.threading``.
* Smarter behavior for progress bars, unified configuration for progress bar. **Breaking change** to ``scalib.attack.SASCAGraph``.
* Add accessors for the internal state of the LDA.
* Introduce the ``scalib.ScalibError`` exception and remove ``scalib.metrics.SnrError`` (**Breaking change**).
* Improve error reporting in case of LDA solving error.
* Allow all computations to be interrupted with Ctrl-C.
* Fix deadlock when there is an error in large SNR computations (i.e., when ``n_vars*n_samples*n_traces > 2**33``).
* Allow LDA to behave like simple pooled gaussian templates (#22).
* Refresh build system (Tox version 4, improved CI), build by default with native machine optimizations.
* Not crash anymore on non x86-64 CPUs (no CI for those yet).

v0.4.3 (2022/10/27)
-------------------

* Upgrade CI to 3.11.
* Update dependancies and add python 3.10 to CI (#49)

v0.4.2 (2022/05/31)
-------------------

* Fix AVX2 not used when building rust dependencies.

v0.4.1 (2022/05/31)
-------------------

* Fix docs not building

v0.4.0 (2022/05/31)
-------------------

* SASCA: support modular ADD and MUL operations (#18)
* TTest: Performance improvement by using a mix of 2 passes and 1 pass algorithms 
* MTTest: First implementation of multivariate T-test.
* Improved documentation and README.rst
* SNR: use pooled formulas for better correctness then there are few traces,
  saves RAM (up to 75% reduction) and improves perf (about 2x single-threaded).
* Bump python minimum version to 3.7
* Revamp multi-threading handling thanks to new `scalib.threading` module.
* AVX2: Wheels on PyPi are built with AVX2 feature. 

v0.3.4 (2021/12/27)
-------------------

* Release GC in SASCA's `run_bp` .
* Release GC in `rank_accurary` and `rank_nbin`.
* `LDA.predict_proba` is marked thread-safe.
* Hide by default the progress bar of `SASCAGraph.run_bp` (can be re-enable
  with the `progress` parameter).

v0.3.3 (2021/07/13)
-------------------

* Solving minor issues in `MultiLDA` and `LDAClassifier`. Allowing multiple
  threads in `predict_proba()` and add a `done` flag to `solve()`.

v0.3.2 (2021/07/12)
-------------------

* Chunk `SNR.fit_u` to maintain similar performances with long traces and
  adding a progress bar 

v0.3.1 (2021/06/03)
-------------------

* Add `max_nb_bin` parameter to `postprocessing.rank_accuracy` (that was
  previously hard-coded).

v0.3.0 (2021/06/01)
-------------------

* Rename `num_threads` parameter of `modeling.MultiLDA` to `num_cpus`.
* Fix rank estimation when there is only one key chunk.
* Improve performance of `SNR.get_snr`.

v0.2.0 (2021/05/20)
-------------------

* Remove OpenBLAS and LAPACK, use Spectra and nalgebra instead.
* Use BLIS for matrix multiplications (Linux-only for now).
* Make `modeling.LDAClassifier` incremental (breaking change).
* Add `modeling.MultiLDA`.

v0.1.1 (2021/04/26)
-------------------

* Fix "invalid instruction" bug for CI wheel on windows.

v0.1.0 (2021/04/16)
-------------------

* Initial release, with the following features:
  * LDA and Gaussian templates modelling
  * SNR
  * T-test any order (for TLVA)
  * Soft Analytical Side-Channel Attack (SASCA)
  * Rank Estimation

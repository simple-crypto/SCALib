Welcome to SCALib
=================
The Side-Channel Analysis Library (SCALib) is a Python package that
contains state-of-the-art tools for side-channel evaluation. It focuses on
providing efficient implementations of analysis methods widely used by the
side-channel community and maintaining a flexible and simple interface.

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib>`_!

Usability & Efficiency
----------------------
SCALib main advantages are:

1. **Incremental APIs**: SCALib leverages as much as possible incremental APIs. That is, 
   it is possible to feed the data in multiple chunks to avoid loading multiple times
   the same data into RAM. 
2. **High Performances**: Despite SCALib is a Python package, it embeds a Rust back-end
   which enables a fine grain control of the implementation.
3. **Efficient Mutli-threading**: Thanks to the Rust back-end, SCALib enables efficient
   parallelism. This is obtained thanks to `Rayon <https://docs.rs/crate/rayon/latest>`_.

Getting Started
===============

Install
-------
You can install SCALib by using PyPi packages and running:

.. code-block::

   pip install scalib

Wheels for Windows and Linux are provided. More information about source
compilation, checkout `DEVELOP
<https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib/blob/main/DEVELOP.rst>`_ page.
Especially, we recommand to compile SCALib to get maximal performances.


SCALib workflow
---------------

The current version of SCALib contains modules for all the necessary steps for a
profiled side-channel attack. Even if modules of SCALib can be used
independently, a typical usage of SCALib for it goes in four steps:

1. **Metrics**: In this step, standard metrics are evaluated from the
   measurements. This helps to find point-of-interest (POIs), quantify avaiable information, etc. 
   When applicable, these metrics are implemented with a one-pass
   algorithm to save the cost of data load / store.

2. **Modeling**: In this step, models are built to extract information about a
   variable `y` from the leakage. Modeling methods work in two phases. The
   first one is to `fit(t,x)` with traces `t` and target values `x`. This creates the
   model parameters. In the second step, this model can be used to 
   `predict_proba(t)` that returns the probability of every possible target values based on the
   traces `t` and the model.

3. **Attacks**: This modules contains attack methodologies. It essentially uses
   the probabilities from the `modeling` step in order and recombine them to
   recover a key. The module `SASCAGraph` is an extension of Divide & Conquer attacks that leverage `soft analytical side-channel attacks`. It allows to define `PROPERTY` that link intermediate varibles within an implementation.
   By providing the `SASCAGraph` with the distributions of these variables, it propagates information on all the variables (e.g. secret keys).

4. **PostProcessing**: Once the attack has been performed, the postprocessing
   allows to evaluate the efficiency of the attack. Namely by estimating the
   rank of the correct key with `rank_accuracy`, it allows to quantify what is
   the remaining computational power that is needed by the adversary to recover
   the correct key.

Pseudo-Example
--------------

Next, we detail a short pseudo example which illustrates the usage of SCALib. 
For a full running example, please visit `this example <https://github.com/simple-crypto/scalib/tree/main/examples/aes_simulation>`_. 

.. code-block::

     # compute snr
     snr = SNR(nc=256,ns=ns,p=1) 
     snr.fit(traces_p,x_p)
     
     # build model
     pois_x = np.argsort(snr.get_snr()[0][:-npoi])
     lda = LDAClassifier(nc=256,ns=npoi,p=1)
     lda.fit(traces_p[:,pois_x],x_p)

     # Describe and generate the SASCAGraph
     graph_desc = ´´´
        # Small unprotected Sbox example
        TABLE sbox   # The Sbox
        VAR SINGLE k # The key
        VAR MULTI p  # The plaintext
        VAR MULTI x  # Sbox input
        VAR MULTI y  # Sbox output
        PROPERTY x = k ^ p   # Key addition
        PROPERTY y = sbox[x] # Sbox lookup
        ´´´
     graph = SASCAGraph(graph_desc,256,len(traces_a))

     # Encode data into the graph
     graph.set_table("sbox",aes_sbox)
     graph.set_public("p",plaintexts)
     graph.set_distribution("x",lda.predict_proba(traces_a))

     # Solve graph
     graph.run_bp(it=3)

     # Get key distribution and derive key guess
     k_distri = graph.get_distribution("k")
     key_guess = np.argmax(k_distri[0,:])

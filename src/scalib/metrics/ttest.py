r"""
The Student's :math:`t`-test can be used to highlight a difference in the means
of two distributions. To do so, a `t` statistic is derived following the
expression:

.. math::
    t = \frac{\mu_0 - \mu_1}{\sqrt{\frac{v_0}{n_0} + \frac{v_1}{n_1}}}

where :math:`\mu_0` (resp. :math:`\mu_1`) is the estimated moment of the first
(resp.second) population and :math:`\frac{v_0}{n_0}` the variance of its
estimate from :math:`n_0` samples. In the context of side-channel analysis, many of
these statistical tests are performed independently for each point of the traces. 
See [1]_ for additional details.

In this module, the definition of :math:`\mu` and :math:`v` are adapted to perform
higher-order univariate and multivariate :math:`t`-test to compare higher-order moments of
two distributions:

- *Higher-order t-tests* pre-process the populations by elevating the traces at
  the :math:`d`-th power, after subtracting the mean (for :math:`d>1`) and
  normalizing the variance (for :math:`d>2`).
- *Multivariate t-test* are a variant of higher-order t-tests where a product
  of :math:`d` samples of the trace is use instead of the :math:`d`-th power of
  a single sample. Mean and variance normalization are applied similarly to
  higher-order t-tests.

**Warning**: Ttest should not be used alone as a standalone evaluation tool
because of its qualitative nature. See [2]_ and [3]_ for cautionary notes.


Implementations Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to enable both efficient one-core and parallelized performance of the
:math:`t`-test implementation, SCALib uses the one-pass formula for estimation
arbitrary order statistical moment from [4]_ and its application to
side-channel context in [1]_.

Concretely, the implementations first compute an estimation of the required
statistical moments using a two-passes algorithms (first pass to compute the
mean and the variances, and a second pass to compute the centered products).
This new estimation is then used to update the current estimation using the
merging rule from [4]_. To enable multi-threading, SCALib internally divides 
the fresh traces into smaller independent chunks and then merges the output of
each threads using [4]_. 

As a conclusion, the performance of the SCALib improves if the two-passes
algorithm can be used on large chunks. Hence, it is recommended to feed a large
enough amount of data for every call to `fit_u()`.

class Ttest:
    r"""Univariate (higher order) :math:`t`-test.

    Concretely, :math:`\mu[j]`'s and :math:`v[j]`'s are computed for
    the `d`-th statistical moment to test at all the indexes (`j`) in the
    traces. These are derived based on all the provided traces :math:`l[:,j]`, that
    can be provided through multiple calls to `fit_u`.

    The statistic `t[j]` is then derived as:

    - for `d=1`:

    .. math::
        \mu[j] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} l[i,j]

    - for `d=2`:

    .. math::
        \mu[j] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (l[i,j] - \bar{l}[:,j])^2

    - for `d>2`:

    .. math::
        \mu[j] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(\frac{l[i,j] - \bar{l}[:,j])}{\sigma_{l[:,j]}}\right)^d

    where, :math:`\bar{l}` denotes the estimated mean of `l` and
    :math:`\sigma_l` its standard deviation.

    A :math:`d`-th order t-test automatically includes the computation of all the lower order t-tests.

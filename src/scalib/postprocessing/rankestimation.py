r"""Estimation of the rank of a true key given likelihood of sub-keys.

Rank estimation estimates the rank of the full (e.g. 128-bit) key based on a
score for each value of its (e.g 8-bit) sub-keys. The scores must be additive
and positive (e.g. negative log probabilities).

`rank_accuracy` allows to specify the desired precision of the bound in
bits (may not be achieved if computationally untractable), while `rank_nbin`
gives direct, lower-level control over the number of bins in the historgrams.


Notes
-----
The rank estimation algorithm is based on [1]_, with the following
optimization: computation of histogram bins with higher score than the expected
key is skipped, since it has no impact on the final rank.

    r"""Estimate the rank of the full keys based on scores based on histograms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : array_like, f64
        Cost for each of the sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,nc)` where
        `ns` is the number of sub-keys, `nc` the possible values of each
        sub-keys.
    key : array_like, int
        Correct full key split in sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,)`.
    nbins : int
        Number of bins for each of the distributions.
    method : string
        Method used to estimate the rank. Can be the following:

        * "hist": using histograms (default).
        * "ntl": using NTL library, allows better precision.

    Returns
    -------
    (rmin, r, rmax): (float, float, float)

            - **rmin** is a lower bound for the key rank.
            - **r** is the stimated key rank.
            - **rmax** is an upper bound for the key rank.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : array_like, f64
        Cost for each of the sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,nc)` where
        `ns` is the number of sub-keys, `nc` the possible values of each
        sub-keys.
    key : array_like, int
        Correct full key split in sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,)`.
    acc_bit : f64, default: 1.0
        Expected log2 accuracy for the key rank estimation. `acc_bit` must so be
        set to `log2(rank_max/rank_min)`.
    method : string
        Method used to estimate the rank. Can be the following:

        * "hist": using histograms (default).

    max_nb_bin : int, default: 2**26
        Maximum number of bins to use (if too low, the requested accuracy might
        not be reached).

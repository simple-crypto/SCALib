r"""Estimation of the rank of a true key given likelihood of sub-keys.

Rank estimation estimates the rank of the full (e.g. 128-bit) key based on a
score for each value of its (e.g 8-bit) sub-keys. The scores must be additive
and positive (e.g. negative log probabilities).

The `rank_accuracy` function allows to specify the desired precision of the
bound in bits. It is the high-level, and its usage is recommended over the
lower-level `rank_nbin` function.
That function gives direct, lower-level control to the core algorithm, allowing
to specify the number of bins in the histograms (whereas `rank_accuracy` tunes
this parameter automatically).

Examples
--------

>>> from scalib.postprocessing import rank_accuracy
>>> import numpy as np
>>> # define the correct key
>>> key = np.random.randint(0,256,16)
>>> # Derive the score for each key byte
>>> scores = np.ones((16,256)) * 1E-5
>>> scores[np.arange(16),key] = 1
>>> # Compute the full key rank (correct key must have rank 1).
>>> (rmin,r,rmax) = rank_accuracy(-np.log(scores),key)
>>> assert r == 1

Notes
-----
The rank estimation algorithm is based on [1]_, with the following
optimization: computation of histogram bins with higher score than the expected
key is skipped, since it has no impact on the final rank.

    r"""Estimate the rank of the full keys based on scores based on histograms.

    Warning: this is a low-level function, you probably want to use
    `rank_accuracy` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : array_like, f64
        Cost for each of the sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,nc)` where
        `ns` is the number of sub-keys, `nc` the possible values of each
        sub-keys.
    key : array_like, int
        Correct full key split in sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,)`.
    nbins : int
        Number of bins for each of the distributions.
    method : string
        Method used to estimate the rank. Can be the following:

        * "hist": using histograms (default).
        * "ntl": using NTL library, allows better precision.

    Returns
    -------
    (rmin, r, rmax): (float, float, float)

            - **rmin** is a lower bound for the key rank.
            - **r** is the estimated key rank.
            - **rmax** is an upper bound for the key rank.

    r"""Estimate the rank of the full keys based on scores based on histograms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : array_like, f64
        Cost for each of the sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,nc)` where
        `ns` is the number of sub-keys, `nc` the possible values of each
        sub-keys.
    key : array_like, int
        Correct full key split in sub-keys. Array must be of shape `(ns,)`.
    acc_bit : f64, default: 1.0
        Expected log2 accuracy for the key rank estimation.

        The algorithms attempts to get a result such that `rmax/rmin < 2^acc_bit`,
        but may not achieve this if the result is computationally intractable.
        In such a case, rank estimate and rank bounds are still returned, but
        the inequality may be violated.
    method : string
        Method used to estimate the rank. Can be the following:

        * "hist": using histograms (default).
        * "ntl": using NTL library, allows better precision.
    max_nb_bin : int, default: 2**26
        Maximum number of bins to use.
        This fixes an upper bound on the computational cost of the algorithm
        (if too low, the requested accuracy might not be reached).

    Returns
    -------
    (rmin, r, rmax): (float, float, float)

            - **rmin** is a lower bound for the key rank.
            - **r** is the estimated key rank.
            - **rmax** is an upper bound for the key rank.
